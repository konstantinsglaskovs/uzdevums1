    <h1>ROMEO AND JULIET</h1>
    <h2>ACT I</h2>
    <h3>PROLOGUE</h3>

    <p style="text-align: center;">
        Two households, both alike in dignity,<br>
        In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,<br>
        From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,<br>
        Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.<br>
        From forth the fatal loins of these two foes<br>
        A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;<br>
        Whose misadventured piteous overthrows<br>
        Do with their death bury their parents' strife.<br>
        The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,<br>
        And the continuance of their parents' rage,<br>
        Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,<br>
        Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;<br>
        The which if you with patient ears attend,<br>
        What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
    </p>

    <h3>SCENE I. Verona. A public place.</h3>
    <p class="stage-direction">Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers</p>

    <div class="character">SAMPSON</div>
    <div class="speech">Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.</div>

    <div class="character">GREGORY</div>
    <div class="speech">No, for then we should be colliers.</div>

    <div class="character">SAMPSON</div>
    <div class="speech">I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.</div>

    <div class="character">GREGORY</div>
    <div class="speech">Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.</div>

    <div class="character">SAMPSON</div>
    <div class="speech">I strike quickly, being moved.</div>

    <div class="character">GREGORY</div>
    <div class="speech">But thou art not quickly moved to strike.</div>

    <div class="character">SAMPSON</div>
    <div class="speech">A dog of the house of Montague moves me.</div>

    <div class="character">GREGORY</div>
    <div class="speech">
        To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:<br>
        therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.
    </div>

    <div class="character">SAMPSON</div>
    <div class="speech">
        A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will<br>
        take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.
    </div>

    <div class="character">GREGORY</div>
    <div class="speech">
        That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes<br>
        to the wall.
    </div>

    <div class="character">SAMPSON</div>
    <div class="speech">
        True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,<br>
        are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push<br>
        Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids<br>
        to the wall.
    </div>

    <div class="character">GREGORY</div>
    <div class="speech">The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.</div>

    <div class="character">SAMPSON</div>
    <div class="speech">
        'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I<br>
        have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the<br>
        maids, and cut off their heads.
    </div>

    <div class="character">GREGORY</div>
    <div class="speech">The heads of the maids?</div>

    <div class="character">SAMPSON</div>
    <div class="speech">
        Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;<br>
        take it in what sense thou wilt.
    </div>

    <div class="character">GREGORY</div>
    <div class="speech">They must take it in sense that feel it.</div>

    <div class="character">SAMPSON</div>
    <div class="speech">
        Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and<br>
        'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.
    </div>

    <div class="character">GREGORY</div>
    <div class="speech">
        'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou<br>
        hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes<br>
        two of the house of the Montagues.
    </div>

    <div class="character">SAMPSON</div>
    <div class="speech">My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.</div>

    <div class="character">GREGORY</div>
    <div class="speech">How! turn thy back and run?</div>

    <div class="character">SAMPSON</div>
    <div class="speech">Fear me not.</div>

    <div class="character">GREGORY</div>
    <div class="speech">No, marry; I fear thee!</div>

    <div class="character">SAMPSON</div>
    <div class="speech">
        Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.
    </div>

    <div class="character">GREGORY</div>
    <div class="speech">
        I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as<br>
        they list.
    </div>

    <div class="character">SAMPSON</div>
    <div class="speech">
        Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them;<br>
        which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
    </div>

    <p class="stage-direction">Enter ABRAHAM and BALTHASAR</p>

    <div class="character">GREGORY</div>
    <div class="speech">No.</div>

    <div class="character">SAMPSON</div>
    <div class="speech">
        No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I<br>
        bite my thumb, sir.
    </div>

    <div class="character">GREGORY</div>
    <div class="speech">Do you quarrel, sir?</div>

    <div class="character">ABRAHAM</div>
    <div class="speech">Quarrel sir! no, sir.</div>

    <div class="character">SAMPSON</div>
    <div class="speech">If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you.</div>

    <div class="character">ABRAHAM</div>
    <div class="speech">No better.</div>

    <div class="character">SAMPSON</div>
    <div class="speech">Well, sir.</div>

    <div class="character">GREGORY</div>
    <div class="speech">Say 'better:' here comes one of my master's kinsmen.</div>

    <div class="character">SAMPSON</div>
    <div class="speech">Yes, better, sir.</div>

    <div class="character">ABRAHAM</div>

    <p class="stage-direction">Enter TYBALT</p>

    <div class="character">TYBALT</div>
    <div class="speech">
        What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?<br>
        Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.
    </div>

    <div class="character">BENVOLIO</div>
    <div class="speech">
        I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,<br>
        Or manage it to part these men with me.
    </div>

    <div class="character">TYBALT</div>
    <div class="speech">
        What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word,<br>
        As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:<br>
        Have at thee, coward!
    </div>

    <p class="stage-direction">They fight</p>

    <div class="character">LADY CAPULET</div>
    <div class="speech">A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?</div>

    <div class="character">CAPULET</div>
    <div class="speech">
        My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,<br>
        And flourishes his blade in spite of me.

    <div class="speech">
        Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,<br>
        Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,—<br>
        Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,<br>
        That quench the fire of your pernicious rage<br>
        With purple fountains issuing from your veins,<br>
        On pain of torture, from those bloody hands<br>
        Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,<br>
        And hear the sentence of your moved prince.<br>
        Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,<br>
        By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,<br>
        Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,<br>
        And made Verona's ancient citizens<br>
        Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,<br>
        To wield old partisans, in hands as old,<br>
        Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:<br>
        If ever you disturb our streets again,<br>
        Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.<br>
        For this time, all the rest depart away:<br>
        You Capulet; shall go along with me:<br>
        And, Montague, come you this afternoon,<br>
        To know our further pleasure in this case,<br>
        To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.<br>
        Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.

    <div class="character">BENVOLIO</div>
    <div class="speech">
        Here were the servants of your adversary,<br>
        And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:<br>
        I drew to part them: in the instant came<br>
        The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,<br>
        Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,<br>
        He swung about his head and cut the winds,<br>
        Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn:<br>
        While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,<br>
        Came more and more and fought on part and part,<br>
        Till the prince came, who parted either part.
